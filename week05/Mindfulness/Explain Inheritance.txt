Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that simplifies class design by eliminating redundancy and promoting code reuse. It allows one class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another, ensuring consistency while reducing duplication.

A key characteristic of inherited classes is that they share a common foundation but exhibit distinct variations. For example, in a mindfulness application, you might have three different types of activitiesâ€”such as breathing exercises, reflection prompts, and guided listening. Instead of rewriting shared functionality for each, they can all inherit common traits from a base Activity class while implementing their unique characteristics.
